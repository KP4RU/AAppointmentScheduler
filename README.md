# AAppointmentScheduler

This Java software simulates processing transactions for vaccination appointments at 5 different locations in New Jersey.

It reads information from the Java standard input, such as patient and appointment information, and creates appointments 
if no errors are present with the date of birth, appointment date, appointment timeslot, and location.
